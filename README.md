#Methodology and Approach
We started the project outlining the corner parts of the whole process. 
To add complexity, we implemented a chatbot with the ability to translate from different languages to find a solution and give back a possible solution in the userâ€™s language. 
We used the agile approach with weekly sprints.

#Design Approach
We started our journey designing process and decision table using Camunda, we walked through Cloud services, deployment tools, and integrations, and we finally ended up on AI and Chatbots. Some of the gathered knowledge in the semester was used to build the solution here presented; more technical details about each tool utilization can be found below.

## Collaboration
For collaboration, we used different platforms; at first, Github Version control was used to manage the technical files like processes modeling, decision tables, and data about our integration services.
As indicated on the assignment, to guarantee a flawless integration, we used one instance of Heroku and one GitHub repository.
The integration part is managed on Integromat in different scenarios.


## Project Management
Tasks were tracked within this documentation and assigned to one of the team members. For such as small team, no designated project leader was chosen. Tasks were taken by the each teammember individually.
